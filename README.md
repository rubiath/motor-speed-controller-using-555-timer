## 🖥️ PCB Design
Later, I designed a PCB using **EasyEDA Pro**.  
Here’s the 3D view of the PCB:

## ⚡ How It Works
The circuit works using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** generated by the **555 Timer IC** in astable mode.  

- The duty cycle of the PWM is adjusted with a potentiometer.  
- This changes the average voltage applied to the DC motor.  
- A MOSFET is used as a switch for efficient motor control.
